Q)What is prop drilling?
-Prop drilling is the process of passing data down through multiple levels of components, even if some 
intermediate components don’t need the data themselves.
-Example: Passing logged-in user info from the root component down to deeply nested children.

Q)What is lifting the state up?
-Lifting state up means moving a state variable from a child component into a common ancestor (usually the parent) 
so that multiple components can share and sync that state.
-We can use this to make our component controlled from uncontrolled(lift it's state to its parent and then pass it as props)
-Remember that accordian example how opening one collapses the remaining 

Q)What is Context Provider and Context Consumer?
-Context Provider
Used to wrap components and provide a value (state, data, functions) that can be accessed by any nested child 
without prop drilling.

-Context Consumer
Used to access context inside components (mostly useful in class components or before useContext hook existed).

Example:

<MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => <div>{value}</div>}
</MyContext.Consumer>

Q)If you don’t pass a value to the provider does it take the default value?
-yes
