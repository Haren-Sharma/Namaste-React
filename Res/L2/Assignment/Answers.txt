Q)What is `NPM`?
-NPM is a repo/store of all the packages available to us that we can install in our project
-It is everything except node package manager(according to official docs)

Q)What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it? 
-Parcel and Webpack are module bundlers (also called build tools).
They take all your project files (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, etc.) and bundle them into optimized files that can run efficiently in a browser.
-Bundler basically bundles our whole app so that it can be shipped to production
-It comes with a lot of benefits:
    -Babel:Browsers don’t understand modern JavaScript directly
    You might write code using JSX (React), ES6+ syntax (import/export, async/await), or TypeScript.
    Browsers can’t run these directly, so bundlers use Babel (or similar) to transpile your code into plain old JavaScript.
    -Hot Module Replacement(every time we save, the changes are reflected instantly)
    -It uses file watching alogorithm(written in C++)
    -Dev and Production Builds
    -Local Server(parcel localhost:1234)
    -Caching - Faster Builds(parcel-cache folder)
    -Image Optimization
    -Minification-smaller bundle size
    -Bundling
    -Compressing
    -Consistent Hashing
    -Code splitting-loads only what’s needed.
    -Differential Bundling(supports older browsers)
    -Error handling
    -HTTPS
    -Tree Shaking(removes unused code)

Q)What is `.parcel-cache` 
-This folder is where Parcel stores cached build data so that it doesn’t need to re-process everything from scratch each time you run it.
-Parcel only rebuilds the files that changed.
-Other files are reused from .parcel-cache.
-This makes builds and hot reloading much faster.

Q)What is `npx` ? 
-npx is a package runner tool that comes bundled with npm (v5.2+).
-It allows you to execute Node.js packages (CLI tools) without installing them globally
-Basically when we want to execute a package
