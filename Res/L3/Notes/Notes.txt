JSX is a javascript syantx which is easier to create react elements
JSX is not html inside javascript 
JSX is a html-like  or XML-like syantx
JSX is not react

When we use React.createElement it gives us a ReactElement(Js Object) =>HTMLElement(render)
But when we use JSX 
JSX is converted/transpiled (by babel) to React.createElement => ReactElement(Js Object) =>HTMLElement(render)
Attributes in JSX are written in camelcase

Babel is a JS compiler
Babel also transpiles / converts the modern js to be compatible for older versions as well

To write JSX in multiple lines we have to enclose our code in ()
const jsdfg=<h1>Namaste JS</h1>

React Components 
-Functional Components
-Class Based Components

React Functional Components
-It is just a javascript function which returns jsx;
-Make the function name Capitalize for e.g Home,Heading,etc.

Rendering a react element 
root.render(heading)

Rendering a react functional component
root.render(<Header/>)

Component Composition
Basically including/composing one component into another

JSX also prevents cross site srcipting attacks for you also 
for e.g
const data=api.getData() //it returned some malicious data
const Head=()=><div>{data}</div> //jsx will not straight away execute the js inside {} it will first check and sanitize the content and then delivers it

These three things are one and the same thing
{Head()}
<Head/>
<Head></Head>
