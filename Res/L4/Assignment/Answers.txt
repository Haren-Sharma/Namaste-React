Q)Is ES6 mandatory for React?
-No, ES6 is not mandatory for React.
-React itself is just a JavaScript library, so it works with plain ES5 JavaScript as well.
-However, ES6+ features (like class, arrow functions, let/const, import/export, destructuring) are commonly used in React code because they make components cleaner, shorter, and easier to maintain.
-Without ES6, you‚Äôd need to use older syntax like React.createClass instead of ES6 class components or use require() instead of import.

‚úÖ Example:

-With ES6:

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello</h1>;
  }
}


-Without ES6:

var App = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");
  }
});

Q)What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></> ?
-In React, a component must return a single parent element.
-If you don‚Äôt want to wrap elements inside unnecessary <div> or other tags, you can use Fragments.
-A Fragment does not render any actual DOM element ‚Äî it‚Äôs ‚Äúinvisible.‚Äù
-Since it doesn‚Äôt produce a real node, you cannot apply CSS classes, inline styles, or attributes to it.

1. <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
-This is the full syntax of a Fragment.
-It allows grouping multiple children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
-Example:

return (
  <React.Fragment>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>World</p>
  </React.Fragment>
);


‚úÖ Output in DOM:

<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>World</p>

2. <> </> (Short Syntax)
-This is the shorthand for React.Fragment.
-Works the same, but it cannot take key or props.
üëâ Common interview point:
If you‚Äôre mapping an array and need to add a key, you must use <React.Fragment key={id}> instead of <>.

Example:

return (
  <>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>World</p>
  </>
);
