Config Driven UI
UI is driven by data/config which comes from backend

Key is very important
If the key is not mentioned ,and a new element comes,react won't know where exactly to place it,so it will re-render the complete 
list
React itself says that don't use indexes as keys
Index as a key is an anti pattern
