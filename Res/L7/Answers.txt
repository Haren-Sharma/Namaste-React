Q)What is SPA?
-A Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of web application where the entire app runs inside a single HTML page (index.html), and 
content is updated dynamically using JavaScript (usually via frameworks like React, Angular, Vue).

Advantages of SPA

Fast navigation → no full page reloads.

Better user experience → feels like a native app.

Less server load → backend mostly provides data (JSON).

Reusable components → common in React, Vue, Angular.

⚠️ Disadvantages of SPA

Initial load can be heavy → needs to download the whole app JS bundle.

SEO issues → since it’s mostly JS-rendered, search engines may struggle (though solutions exist like SSR / prerendering).

Back/forward navigation issues (if routing isn’t handled properly).

JavaScript dependency → app won’t work if JS fails or is disabled.

Q)What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
Client-Side Routing (CSR)

Who handles the routing? 👉 The browser (via JavaScript).

How it works?

The app loads a single index.html.

When you click a link, JavaScript (e.g., react-router-dom) intercepts it.

It changes the URL in the address bar (using the History API: pushState, replaceState).

Instead of making a new request to the server, it swaps/loads a component inside the same page.


Server-Side Routing (SSR or Traditional Routing)

Who handles the routing? 👉 The server.

How it works?

Every time you click a link, the browser sends an HTTP request (GET /about).

The server looks up that route and responds with a new HTML page.

Browser reloads the page with the new content.
